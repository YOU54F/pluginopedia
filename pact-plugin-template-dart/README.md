Template project to help bootstrap a new Pact [Plugin](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-plugins) for the [Pact](http://docs.pact.io) framework. 

**Features:**

* Stubbed gRPC methods ready to implement
* Automated release procedure
* Support for recommended common platform/targets
* Levelled logging for observability

**TODO**

- [ ] Support Matchers and Generators (requires FFI package support)

## Developing the plugin

### Prerequsites

The protoc compiler must be installed for this plugin 

See Dart specific instructions [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf.dart/tree/master/protoc_plugin#how-to-build)

### Create your new repository

1. Clone this repository 
2. Create a new repository in GitHub. The name of the plugin should be `pact-<PROJECT>-plugin` e.g. `pact-protobuf-plugin`
3. Push this code to your new repository

### Install the project dependencies

Run:

```
dart pub global activate protoc_plugin
dart pub get
```

To ensure the dependencies and vendoring are correct.

### Set the name and version

In the top of the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) set `PROJECT` to your plugin's name.

`PROJECT` should map to `<PROJECT>` in your GitHub repository.

*NOTE: It's important that the name of your GitHub project and the `PROJECT` variable must align, to create artifacts discoverable to the CLI tooling, such as the [Plugin CLI](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/pact_plugins/cli).*

### Design the consumer interface

This is how the users of your plugin will write the plugin specific interaction details. 

For example, take the following HTTP interaction:

```js
await pact
  .addInteraction()
  .given('the Matt protocol exists')
  .uponReceiving('an HTTP request to /matt')
  .usingPlugin({
    plugin: 'matt',
    version: '0.0.4',
  })
  .withRequest('POST', '/matt', (builder) => {
    builder.pluginContents('application/matt', mattRequest); // <- request
  })
  .willRespondWith(200, (builder) => {
    builder.pluginContents('application/matt', mattResponse); // <- response
  })
  .executeTest((mockserver) => {
          ...
```          

The user needs to specify the request and response body portion of the request.

Because the use cases for plugins are so wide and varied, the framework does not impose limits
on this data structure and is something you need to design.

This being said, most plugins have opted to use a JSON structure. 

This structure is represented in our GoLang template in [`configuration.go`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-plugin-template-golang/blob/main/configuration.go)

Think about how you would like your user to specify the interaction details for the various interaction types. 

Here is an example for a TCP plugin with a custom text protocol:

#### Synchronous Messages

Set the expected response from the API:

```go
mattMessage := `{"response": {"body": "hellotcp"}}`
```

#### Asynchronous Messages

Set the request/response all in one go:

```go
mattMessage := `{"request": {"body": "hellotcp"}, "response":{"body":"tcpworld"}}`
```

#### HTTP

Separate out the body on the request/response part of the interaction:

```go
mattRequest := `{"request": {"body": "hello"}}`
mattResponse := `{"response":{"body":"world"}}`
```

### Write the Plugin!

#### Implement the relevant RPC functions

Open [`plugin.dart`](./plugin.dart) and update the relevant RPC functions. 

Depending on your use case, some of the RPC calls won't be required, each method is well signposted to help you along.

#### Logging

You should log regularly. Debugging gRPC calls from the framework can be challenging, as the plugin is started asynchronously by the Plugin Driver behind the scenes.

There are two ways to log:

1. Stdout - all stdout (e.g. `print`) is pulled into the general Pact logs for the framework you're running
2. To file. All calls to `log` will be written to a file

The log setup has three main features:

1. [X] It works with the native `dart:io` package
2. [X] It logs to a file relative to plugin execution in `log/plugin.log`
3. [ ] It is levelled, at the direction of the plugin driver (that is, the log level will pass in from the driver which will restrict the levels logged in this plugin)

<!-- To write something to the log file, you simply call the `log` method, with the level prefixed as per below: -->
To write something to the log file, you simply call the `log` method

`log(message)`

<!-- ```golang
log.Println("[TRACE] ...")
log.Println("[DEBUG] ...")
log.Println("[INFO] ...")
log.Println("[WARN] ...")
log.Println("[ERROR] ...")
``` -->

### Publish your plugin

Follow the steps in [Releasing](./RELEASING.md) to publish a new version of your Plugin. 

## Local Development

The following command will build the plugin, and install into the correct plugin directory for local development:

```
make install_local
```

You can then reference your plugin in local tests to try it out.

### Regenerating the plugin protobuf definitions

If a new protobuf definition is required (e.g. to support a new feature), copy it into the `proto` folder and run the following Make task:

```
make proto
```

It will update the definitions in the `./proto/plugin.*.dart` packages. Note this may result in a breaking change, depending on the version. So upgrade carefully and ensure you have appropriate tests

## Supported targets

This code base should automatically create artifacts for the following OS/Architecture combiations:

| OS      | Architecture | Supported |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| OSX     | x86_64       | âœ…         |
| OSX     | arm          | âœ…         |
| Linux   | x86_64       | âœ…         |
| Linux   | arm          | âœ…         |
| Windows | x86_64       | âœ…         |
