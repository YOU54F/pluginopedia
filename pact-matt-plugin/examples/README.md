# Example

Due to a conflict with Pact Go (it uses the same protobuf definition in a test, and in Golang, all protobuf definitions are loaded into the same namespace resulting in a conflict), the examples have been pushed to https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/tree/feat/matt-plugin-example/examples/plugin.

They are copied here for convenience.
